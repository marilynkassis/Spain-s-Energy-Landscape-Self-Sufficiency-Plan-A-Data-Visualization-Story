A data visualization project exploring Spain's energy challenges, consumption patterns, and a proposed solar energy self-sufficiency plan using Tableau and storytelling techniques.

# Spain's Energy Landscape & Self-Sufficiency Plan: A Data Visualization Story

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Spain's energy landscape through interactive data visualizations. Using Tableau, we highlight critical trends in energy consumption, the growing impact of climate change, and a roadmap for Spain's transition towards renewable energy and energy independence by 2074.

## Project Overview

Spain's rising temperatures and reliance on external energy sources underscore the need for sustainable solutions. This project dives into Spain's energy challenges and proposes a 50-year solar energy self-sufficiency plan to reduce dependency, mitigate climate change, and leverage the country's geographical advantages.

### Key Features:
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive Tableau dashboards showcasing energy consumption trends, regional energy generation, and solar energy potential.
- **Climate Change Insights:** An analysis of Spain's temperature rise from 15°C in 1973 to nearly 19°C in 2023, with projections for 2050.
- **Energy Dependency:** Visualized Spain's journey from 81% energy dependence in 2006 to below 70% in 2021.
- **Solar Energy Plan:** A detailed 50-year plan to achieve 70% energy self-sufficiency by 2074 through photovoltaic energy.

## Methodology

1. **Data Sourcing:** Collected historical data on energy consumption, generation, and climate patterns from reliable sources.
2. **Visualization Tools:** Built dashboards in Tableau to present key insights and trends in a clear, impactful way.
3. **Storytelling Approach:** Created a narrative linking Spain's climate and energy challenges to actionable solutions.

## Visuals and Key Insights

### Spanish Temperature Insights:
- Displayed a 50-year timeline of temperature increases, highlighting the urgency of addressing climate change.


### Energy Dependency:
- Showcased Spain's declining reliance on external energy sources, emphasizing the transition to renewables.


### Solar Energy Potential:
- Mapped regional solar energy potential and identified Extremadura, Castilla-La Mancha, and Andalucía as prime locations.


### Energy Self-Sufficiency Plan:
- Visualized the 50-year investment and generation forecast for achieving energy independence.


## Results and Impact

- **Energy Consumption vs. Generation:** Highlighted Spain's gap of 200,000 GWh between consumption and generation in 2021.
- **Solar Energy Growth:** Illustrated the rise of solar energy, now contributing 10.1% to Spain's energy mix as of 2022.
- **Roadmap to Sustainability:** Provided a clear path to generate over 70% of consumed energy by 2074.
